                    <p>Many people think of personal finance(PF) as something only rich people need to be concerned about, but it should be a serious concern for everyone. PF involves everything from paying your rent to figuring out how to pay for a vacation</p>
                    <p>PF is the process we use to check our current financial state, no matter how dismal you might think it is, against your long-term goals. Contrary to popular belief, it's not actually complicated. It just takes a little bit of leg work.</p>
                    <p>This blog will explore the simple steps you can use to take control of your money and gain financial independence, whatever form that might take for you.</p>

                    <p>The very first step most people need to take on their journey to financial freedom is to determine their goals. These goals will vary from person to person since everyone's life situation is different.</p>
                    <p>The goal here isn't to figure out anything about your money, but rather what you wish you could do with your life. Do you want to have kids? Do you want to be debt free? Do you want to buy a house? What age would you like to retire at? </p>
                    <p>You cannot make any plan for your money if you don't first know what you hope to achieve with it.</p>
