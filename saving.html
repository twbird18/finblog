                    <p>Emergency savings are savings for unanticipated events. They happen to everyone. You total your car. Your washing machine breaks down. You have to fly home for a family emergency. Life is always happening and causing unexpected expenses.</p>
                    <p>There are several schools of thought on how much money you need in your fund. Typically, you should start with a goal of saving $500 for a rainy day and progress from there. Most experts recommend that you save 3-6 months of expenses so you're ready, not just for every day emergencies, but for potential unemployment. To calculate that number, I hope you have done the work on creating your <a href="budget.html#budgeting">budget</a> so you know what your monthly expenses are. </p>
                    <p>To get started on your fund, open a new high-yield savings account at your current bank or somehwere online such as Ally bank. Don't panic about needing to save such a large some of money. You don't have to do it all at once. Simply pick the day after pay day and set an automatic transfer from your main account of an amount you feel you can afford, even if it's only $5. You can always change it later or add more money when you have it.</p>
                    <p>This is the first most important step to getting out of debt because every time you have an emergency, you incur more debt. If you've established a fund, you won't increase your debt the next time something happens.</p>

                    <p>One of the biggest expenditures most people have is paying their taxes. So, it should make sense that you should take steps to minimize the amount of money you owe.</p>
                    <p>The first question you should ask yourself is, did you get a large refund on your last tax return? If you did and you are still earning around the same level of income, then you should change your withholdings so that you pay less taxes every check. I know it's fun to get that big check every year, but you're giving an interest free loan to Uncle Sam of money that you could be using to pay off your debt, set up your emergency fund, or just increase your retirement savings. </p>
                    <p>Next, you should read this <a href="https://www.gocurrycracker.com/never-pay-taxes-again/" target="_blank">post</a> and find out how to minimize your tax bill. This requires a little bit of leg work to learn why you're paying taxes and whether or not their are deduction that could apply to you. For instance, many people don't know about the Saver's Credit, which is a tax credit for saving money. You can lower your taxes by saving for retirement and then if your income is below a certain level, the government will give you a reward for it. That sounds like a pretty good deal to me.</p>
