                    <h3>Cable</h3>
                    <h5>Do I really need cable? <span>April 26, 2019</span></h5>
                </div>
                <!-- blog text -->
                <div class="blog-text-right">
                    <p>One of the biggest expenses many people have are their cable bills. Do you know how much your bill is every month?</p>
                    <p>It used to be that people have only 2 options for television, cable or satellite, but these days, there are so many option that it is difficult to keep up with them.</p>
                    <p>The first thing you need to know is how much you are spending. The second thing you need to know is how much television does your household watch? Finally, what are your other options?</p>
                    <p>Once you have armed yourself with this information, you can figure out how to lower your bill.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of things to consider here. How much TV do you actually watch? Do you need cable/satellite or could you use a streaming service? Do you already have a streaming service? For instance if you use Amazon Prime then you have Prime video which includes a lot of movies and TV shows. If you watch very little television in your home or you are really trying to cut back, you should check with your local library. Library cards are free to you after all, covered by your taxes. Many libraries not only have e-books available these days, but provide free access to streaming services such as Kanopy which can give low hour viewers enough shows to watch without costing them a monthly fee.</p>
                    <p>Let's pretend you actually watch 20+ hours of television/week (don't judge me, I have a lot of free time) and you like to watch documentaries and independent films. You could cancel your current provider and pay the much lower cost for Netflix while also using your Amazon subscription to access those types of things at a significant savings. Or maybe you like British and Australian television, then Acorn streaming service is for you. </p>
                    <p>Many people are hesitant to cut their chord because of sports, but now you can get a streaming package for most major sports or simply get a service such as hulu live during your favorite sports season. Then you're only paying for the cost (lower than cable) during your sport's season</p>
                    <p>An important consideration for potentially cutting the chord is whether you have fast enough internet to support that. If you don't live in a city, it's possible that you don't have access to fast internet. In that case, you still have to potential to rent items from your library and make use of Netflix or RedBox for DVDs instead of cable/satellit.</p>
                    <p>Your final consideration should be what's on your bill. If you are keeping your cable, are there services that you don't use? Are you paying for any box tops that you don't need? Do you even need a box top? If you have a smart TV or a streaming device, you may be able to access your cable provider that way. Furthermore, you cable provider is required by law to offer you a cable card for free (with few exceptions).

                    <p>How fast is your internet? Are you paying for too much? That’s a question you can answer by considering what you use the internet for.</p>

                    <table>
	<tr>
		<th> I use it for…</th>
		<th> You need…</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Web surfing</td>
<td>1 Mbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>Online gaming</td>
<td>1 -3 Mbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>SD Video Streaming</td>
<td>3-4 Mbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>HD Video Streaming</td>
<td>5-8 Mbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>File Sharing</td>
<td>50+ Mbps</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So, if you’re paying for the fastest internet available, odds are that you don’t need it and can switch to a slower cheaper plan. </p>
<p>Other considerations are fees. If you’re renting equipment from your provider, you should stop. In most cases, you’ll have a savings by purchasing the equipment either from them or an equivalent device from somewhere online. </p>

                    <p>Once upon a time, everyone had a landline in there house. Then people began buying cell phones. Then everyone had unlimited everything on their phone. Everyone had a contract. It was the only way, but that’s not the case anymore. There are a lot of options for providers, contracts or contract free, and various forms of service.
</p>
<p>How much is your bill? How much do you talk, text or use data? Do you have access to WiFi at your work, school, and home? Do you travel internationally? These are the questions you need to answer before you can lower your bill. Once you know this, you can consider the vast options available these days.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have access to WiFi nearly everywhere you go, you don’t need to pay that massive bill for unlimited (or limited) data. Instead, you can consider one of the MNVOs that reward you for WiFi usage. I personally have used Republic Wireless and Google Fi. With both services, I paid about $30/mo. Currently, I have Fi because it works worldwide with the same bill structure so I don’t have to make any changes or take additional steps when I go overseas. Additionally, it has free hotspotting and is actually an unlimited plan at $80/mo which only charges you for what you actually use. The plan actually costs $20 for talk and text plus $10/GB with an $80/cap on your total bill. If you’re someone who doesn’t use much data on your phone or has the capability to stay on WiFi this is a great deal. </p>
<p>If you’re someone who doesn’t talk or text much there are other MNVO’s that have lower cost plans including less minutes. If you need coverage from a particular company, because they cover your area, you need only do a quick search to find out who leases from them. </p>
