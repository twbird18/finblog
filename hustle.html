                    <p>An often overlooked way to raise income is to consider skills you already have and how you can use them to earn money. Perhaps you like to build things or organize things. There are several online sites where you can list your personal skills and get hired to assist other people. You can even do this virtually as a virtual assistant.</p>

                    <p>There are a wide variety of methods for filling your spare minutes online and earning a little pocket change. This won't get you rich but could buy you a meal or two out every month. Usually, you earn $0.01-0.02 for each small task that you do. Often they are repetitive and boring. You can do anything from working at Amazon Mechanical Turk to transcription work at Rev. There are short surveys that you could fill out or you could even assist in machine learnign through a site like <a href="https://app.spare5.com/fives" target="_blank">Spare5</a>.</p>
