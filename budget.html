                <div class="blog-text-center" id="budgeting">
                    <p>If you want to be financially fit, you need to have a budget. I know tons of people who don’t have budgets, have no idea where there money goes & can’t fathom why they should make any changes. I would like to point out the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. You won’t be young forever.</li>
                        <li>2. The more money you spend, the longer you have to work. Maybe you don’t mind working, but ultimately there will come a time when you stop working & you will need more than potential social security benefits for this.</li>
                        <li>3. If you don’t know where you money goes, will you know if you are being overcharged? if someone has stolen from you? if you are just wastefully spending all of your money?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are tons of different approaches to to managing your money. When you are just starting out learning to manage your money – whether you are in debt or not – the key is to spend within your means. This means that you must first learn where your money is going. So the key first step is to track your spending. How you do this depends on how you spend money. If you mainly use cash, then you will have to manually track by saving your receipts or writing it down, but if you mainly use an electronic method this can be done more simply. Look at your bank statements and fill out categories in a spreadsheet.</p>
                    <p> Alternatively, you can sign up for a multitude of online services. 2 really good free sources are Mint & Personal Capital. Both are excellent safe ways to track your spending & sort it into categories. You can link every account you own to get a complete financial picture. I personally prefer Personal Capital because it has a more robust system & Mint doesn’t look at everything that interest me, but for many people Mint is an ideal online source because you can more easily track your budget their.</p>
                    <p>You will need to look at several months in order to get a complete picture. This is because you need to know an average of how much money you are spending on things like food, gas, utilities, etc. You will also need to know how much you are spending on various intermittent expenses like filling your propane tank, charity organizations, insurance, etc. Make a list of categories.</p>
                    <p>Determine how much you spend on average in each category.
                        <p>
                            <p>Include everything – this means that you need to think about yearly expenses such as taxes, insurance, vacations, etc.
                                <p>
                                    <p>After you have done this – you need to determine how much income you make every month. Ideally you will not include intermittent income that isn’t dependable such as bonuses, commissions and overtime, but for some people these are regular and dependable and can be included. Your budget should not be speculative. It should be based on actual income you expect to receive and not dependent on income that you might not get.</p>
                                    <p>Now you have some options – you can make a spreadsheet budget (my personal choice), create a budget in Mint, download YouNeedABudget or find another online budgeting option.</p>
